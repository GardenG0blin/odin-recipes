    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice noodles</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Tofu</li>
        <li>Tamarind sauce</li>
        <li>Palm sugar (plain sugar works fine)</li>
        <li>Fish sauce</li>
        <li>Fresh and/or dried shrimp</li>
        <li>Garlic or shallots</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bean sprouts</li>
        <li>Red chili pepper</li>
        <li>Peanuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Pad Thai Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add palm sugar to a small pot and melt over medium heat. Once the sugar is melting, keep stirring until it darkens in colour. Immediately add water, fish sauce, and tamarind paste. The sugar will harden immediately and this is okay.</li>
        <li>Bring sauce to a simmer, then turn off heat. The hardened sugar will not have dissolved at this point, but let it sit while you prep other ingredients and it should be dissolved by the time you need it. Check that it is dissolved before you start cooking!</>
    </ol>    
    <h3>Cooking the Pad Thai</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut drained noodles once with scissors so they are half as long. This makes them easier to toss and separate in the wok.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine tofu, garlic, shallots, preserved radish, dried shrimp, and chili flakes.</li>
        <li>Heat a wok or a large nonstick skillet over high heat and add just enough oil to coat the bottom. Sear shrimp, or whatever protein you're using, until done and remove them from pan.</li>
        <li>In the same wok over medium heat, add a little more oil if needed, then add everything in the tofu bowl and saut√© for a few minutes until garlic starts to turn golden and shallots are wilted. If the wok looks dry, add a little more oil. (Don't skimp on oil otherwise the noodles will clump up together.)</li>
        <li>Turn heat up to high then add noodles and sauce. Keep tossing until all the sauce is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Once sauce is absorbed, you can turn off the heat and taste the noodles for doneness. If they're still undercooked, add a little more water and continue cooking, being careful not to add too much water!</li>
        <li>Once noodles are done, push them to one side of the pan. Add add little extra oil to the empty space and add eggs. Break the yolks, then put noodles on top of eggs and cook for about 30 seconds. Flip and toss to mix eggs into noodles.</li>
        <li>Toss the cooked protein back in, plus any collected juices. Then add bean sprouts, garlic chives and half of the peanuts. Turn off the heat and toss until well mixed.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with a lime wedge and extra peanuts on top. For a classic presentation you can add a little extra side of bean sprouts and some garlic chives garnish.</li>
        <li>Be sure to squeeze a bit of lime on top before eating!</li>
    </ol>
